intilialization

the purpose of this step is to know the length of the chromose and intiliaze it with the bool values

we need following things for calculating the length
precision
no of dimension
ranges of each dimension

we start setting up a domain vector(adomain)
in which we set domain for ever dimension...if there are 3 dimension then domain will be equal to 3*2
e.g for the first dimension it could be {0}...[3]
the second dimension coul be [4].....[8]

then we made a class chromosome_length.h..In which we introduce the constructor chromosome_length which takes in three parameters
aPrecision
aNDIM
aDomain

Chromosome_Length::Chromosome_Length(unsigned int aPrecision,

                                     unsigned int aNDIM,

                                     std::vector<double>& adomain):thePrecision(aPrecision), theNDIM(aNDIM), domain(adomain)

{

   if(theNDIM != domain.size()/2)

   {

      //Throw exception

   }

}
 in this constructor we throw an exception if the domain size is not divisible by 2 then program will generate an error



in the following method which is called build chromosome
we are incoporating two steps here  in the first step we start with calculation the length of the first dimension.That lenght is computed by using a method computelength 
unsigned int Chromosome_Length::computeLength(double aLowerLimit, 
                                              double anUpperLimit)
{
   unsigned int length = 0;
   
   double total = (anUpperLimit - aLowerLimit)*std::pow(10, thePrecision);
   
   while(total > std::pow(2, length)) length++;
   
   return length;

here it compute the length of the first dimension and goes back to it's original method 
	
unsigned int length = computeLength(domain[2*i], domain[2*i+1]);
         theLengths.push_back(length);
         chromosomeLength += length;

the compute length will transfer it values to length which then will be stored in another vector called theLengths
the chromosomeLength will actually tell the total lengthe of the whole chromosome
theChromosome.reserve(chromosomeLength);
then the chromosomeLength is used as a total size of the another vector of bool know as theChromosome
