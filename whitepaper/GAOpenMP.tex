\begin{abstract}
We present a detailed description of a multi-dimensional genetic algorithm implemented in C++11 and the OpenMP library.  The use of the OpenMP library allows for the algorithm to be implemented using parallel processing and hence operate in an extremely efficient manner.  The algorithm also offers a considerable degree of flexibility in allowing the user to experiment with different cross-over operators.  Results are presented for several multi-dimensional functions and in comparison to more common genetic algorithms available.

\subsection{Chromosome Builder}
The Chromosome Builder is responsible for creating a family of chromosomes from the domain space chosen by the user.  Each chromosome is represented as an array of \textit{boolean} values.  Although C++ provides a bitset data structure, as part of its Standard Template Library (STL), it does not have the flexibility of determining the length of a bitset at runtime.  Therefore an array was chosen which could be dynamically altered to map to the user supplied domain space.  The length of the chromosome is bound by the domain space, for a given dimension of range [a:b] we have 

\begin{equation}
2^{N_{1}-1}<(b-a)\cdot1000\leq2^{N_{1}}
\end{equation}

% If in two-column mode, this environment will change to single-column
% format so that long equations can be displayed. Use
% sparingly.
%\begin{widetext}
% put long equation here
%\end{widetext}

% figures should be put into the text as floats.
% Use the graphics or graphicx packages (distributed with LaTeX2e)
% and the \includegraphics macro defined in those packages.
% See the LaTeX Graphics Companion by Michel Goosens, Sebastian Rahtz,
% and Frank Mittelbach for instance.
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a figure:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Use the figure* environment if the figure should span across the
% entire page. There is no need to do explicit centering.

% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{}%
% \caption{\label{}}
% \end{figure}

% Surround figure environment with turnpage environment for landscape
% figure
% \begin{turnpage}
% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{}%
% \caption{\label{}}
% \end{figure}
% \end{turnpage}

% tables should appear as floats within the text
%
% Here is an example of the general form of a table:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Insert the column specifiers (l, r, c, d, etc.) in the empty braces of the
% \begin{tabular}{} command.
% The ruledtabular enviroment adds doubled rules to table and sets a
% reasonable default table settings.
% Use the table* environment to get a full-width table in two-column
% Add \usepackage{longtable} and the longtable (or longtable*}
% environment for nicely formatted long tables. Or use the the [H]
% placement option to break a long table (with less control than 
% in longtable).
% \begin{table}%[H] add [H] placement to break table across pages
% \caption{\label{}}
% \begin{ruledtabular}
% \begin{tabular}{}
% Lines of table here ending with \\
% \end{tabular}
% \end{ruledtabular}
% \end{table}

% Surround table environment with turnpage environment for landscape
